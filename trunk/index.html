        <h1>Game of the Goosebots</h1>
        <p>This is an automated game of the goose. It's completely and utterly pointless. The only interaction you can have with it is: you get to pick the number of participating geese. Then you get to watch and follow the exiting race between geese vying for greatness.</p>
